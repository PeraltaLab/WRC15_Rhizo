Bledsoe RB, Goodwillie C, and Peralta AL. 2020. Long-term nutrient enrichment of an oligotroph-dominated wetland increases bacterial diversity in bulk soils and plant rhizospheres. [biorxiv pre-print](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.01.08.899781) 

Raw sequence files can be found at NCBI SRA BioProject ID PRJNA599142.

## We address the following question

* **Aim**: How does long-term nutrient additions impact microbial community diveristy, composition, and life-history in plant rhizospheres?

### Repo Contents

* **analyses:** An R Markdown file that includes R script written by Regina Bledsoe, Ariane Peralta, and Mario Muscarella containing functions used in analysis of soil and microbial sequence data.

* **bin:** 
	* *MothurTools.R*: An R script written by Mario Muscarella containing functions used in the analysis of community sequence data.

* **data:** Files associated with soil and microbial data sets. 

* **figures:** Figures (of soil, microbes) generated according to R script located in R Markdown file.

* **mothur:** Files containing script for bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Illumina MiSeq platform) using mothur pipeline.
